# Machine Learning Mini Project

This repository contains the course project for CSC8635: Machine Learning with Project at Newcastle University.

## Summary
This project explores various machine learning techniques across three different tasks:

1. **Classification Task**
   - Investigating machine learning approaches to classify accident severity in an imbalanced dataset.

2. **Regression Task**
   - Applying machine learning to predict the growth rate of bacteria based on given features.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Task**
   - Implementing machine learning models to cluster different types of news articles based on textual data.

Each task involves data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and performance analysis.
